# Infinity Branch
***

The Infinity branch of Nebula is the superbranch/master branch for Nebula.
This branch is "special" because not a lot of stuff is here.

The Infinity branch is where all the uncategorized stuff goes.
It is also used as the "superbase" for Nebula.
When I say superbase I mean that this is all the things Nebula and Nebula-based admins will have.

It may contain the following:
* Security system (_including anti-steal_)
* Pre-loader
* Information
* Credits
* Etc.
